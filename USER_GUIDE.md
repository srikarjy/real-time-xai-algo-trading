### Example Explanations

#### Price Drop Strategy (BUY)
```
üìâ Price Drop Detected!

The stock price has dropped by 5.2%, which is more than your threshold of 5%.

What this means:
- The stock is now cheaper than it was before
- This could be a temporary dip or a buying opportunity
- You're getting more shares for the same amount of money

Why this strategy works:
- Stocks often bounce back after significant drops
- You're buying when others might be selling (contrarian approach)
- Lower prices mean higher potential returns
```

#### Moving Average Strategy (BUY)
```
üìà Trend Reversal Detected!

The short-term average ($150.25) has crossed above the long-term average ($148.75).

What this means:
- The stock is gaining momentum
- Recent prices are higher than the long-term average
- This suggests an upward trend is starting

Think of it like: A car that was slowing down is now accelerating again.
```
