# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for rebuilding the Real-Time XAI Trading Algorithm Platform in Rust. The platform allows users to create trading strategies, execute them against live stock data, and receive explainable AI insights about trading decisions. The Rust implementation will focus on performance, safety, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to create custom trading strategies with configurable parameters, so that I can test different approaches to the market.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a strategy type THEN the system SHALL display appropriate configuration fields
2. WHEN a user provides strategy parameters THEN the system SHALL validate the inputs before creating the strategy
3. WHEN a strategy is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier and store the configuration
4. IF strategy parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
5. WHEN a user creates a price drop strategy THEN the system SHALL accept symbol and threshold percentage parameters
6. WHEN a user creates a moving average strategy THEN the system SHALL accept symbol, short period, and long period parameters
7. WHEN a user creates an RSI strategy THEN the system SHALL accept symbol, oversold level, and overbought level parameters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to receive real-time stock data for my selected symbols, so that my strategies can operate on current market information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a strategy is started THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to real-time stock data feeds
2. WHEN new market data arrives THEN the system SHALL update the current price within 5 seconds
3. WHEN the data connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
4. WHEN historical data is needed THEN the system SHALL fetch at least 30 days of price history
5. IF the stock symbol is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
6. WHEN multiple strategies are active THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage data feeds to avoid duplicate requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want my strategies to execute automatically based on market conditions, so that I don't miss trading opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market data updates THEN the system SHALL evaluate all active strategies within 1 second
2. WHEN strategy conditions are met THEN the system SHALL generate a BUY, SELL, or HOLD signal
3. WHEN a price drop strategy threshold is exceeded THEN the system SHALL generate a BUY signal
4. WHEN moving averages cross over THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate trading signals
5. WHEN RSI levels breach oversold/overbought thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding signals
6. WHEN a trading signal is generated THEN the system SHALL record the trade with timestamp and price

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to understand why the AI made specific trading decisions, so that I can learn and improve my strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trading signal is generated THEN the system SHALL provide a human-readable explanation
2. WHEN a price drop is detected THEN the explanation SHALL include the percentage change and threshold comparison
3. WHEN moving averages trigger a signal THEN the explanation SHALL describe the crossover and trend implications
4. WHEN RSI triggers a signal THEN the explanation SHALL explain the momentum and market psychology
5. WHEN no action is taken THEN the system SHALL explain why conditions were not met
6. WHEN explanations are generated THEN they SHALL be written in plain language accessible to non-technical users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see real-time visualizations of price movements and trading signals, so that I can monitor my strategies effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a real-time price chart
2. WHEN trading signals are generated THEN they SHALL appear as markers on the price chart
3. WHEN BUY signals occur THEN they SHALL be displayed as green upward triangles
4. WHEN SELL signals occur THEN they SHALL be displayed as red downward triangles
5. WHEN the user hovers over chart elements THEN detailed information SHALL be displayed
6. WHEN new data arrives THEN the chart SHALL update automatically without page refresh

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to track the performance of my strategies, so that I can evaluate their effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trades are executed THEN the system SHALL calculate running performance metrics
2. WHEN performance is displayed THEN it SHALL include total return percentage and trade count
3. WHEN a strategy is active THEN the system SHALL track current position and average price
4. WHEN trade history is requested THEN the system SHALL display the most recent trades with explanations
5. WHEN multiple strategies are running THEN performance SHALL be tracked separately for each
6. WHEN the simulation starts THEN the system SHALL initialize with a configurable cash amount

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that temporary issues don't crash my trading strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connections fail THEN the system SHALL continue operating with cached data
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
3. WHEN invalid data is received THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with valid data
4. WHEN WebSocket connections drop THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt reconnection
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL notify users through the interface
6. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to be performant and resource-efficient, so that it can handle multiple concurrent users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple WebSocket connections are active THEN the system SHALL handle them concurrently
2. WHEN processing market data THEN CPU usage SHALL remain below 50% under normal load
3. WHEN storing trade data THEN memory usage SHALL scale linearly with active strategies
4. WHEN serving API requests THEN response times SHALL be under 100ms for 95% of requests
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL be ready to accept connections within 5 seconds
6. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
